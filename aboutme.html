    <h1> Me Myself and I </h1>
    <p>My name is Dharynka Tapia and i was born on the 23rd of november which makes me 15 years old.
   I live with my mom and my brother who is 12 years old and is attending middle school.
        This year i would be entering into my junior year and this would be my first year in being a part of Girls Who Code.
        I really enjoy wathcing netflix as well as taking pictures of nature and its beauty (but that's more of a hidden hobby/like).
          A fun fact about me is that my favorite color is blue and my favorite animal is a sloth.
      Although I do have many dislikes such as eggs and seafood in which i can not stand the odor or the taste and i as well extremely dislike
      frogs and snails.
